The was a LIVE-project given to us by HiCounselor to gain REAL-WORLD experience using the dataset from Zomato, a leading food delivery app. We worked in teams of 4.

## The primary aim of the project is to clean and analyze the dataset to uncover useful insights and information. 

Python was utilized for preprocessing and cleaning the data. 
You can find the python codes and relevent outputs [here](https://github.com/mythilyram/Food_delivery_app_data_analysis/blob/main/Food_Delivery_App_Data_Analysis.ipynb).

SQL was used to perform the data analysis and find insights. 
You can find the SQL codes and relevent outputs in an article in [medium](https://medium.com/@mythilyrm/food-delivery-app-data-analysis-edf0389929ce).
