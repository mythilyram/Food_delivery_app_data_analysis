# Food_delivery_app_data_analysis
The was a LIVE-project given to us by HiCounselor to gain REAL-WORLD experience using the dataset from Zomato, a leading food delivery app. We worked in teams of 4.

The primary aim of the project is to clean and analyze the dataset to uncover useful insights and information. To achieve this, Python was utilized for preprocessing and cleaning the data, while SQL was used to perform the data analysis.
